VoidBot is a bot i no longer want to maintain


How to setup:

1. Add to a server with discord.js already setup
2. Upload the zip to the server
3. Unzip the file
4. Change the bot token in botconfig.json and index.js
5. Change the prefix in config.json (By default it's + like the real VoidBot)

Thank you for downloading and supporting Voidem Development

⚠️THE ORIGINAL BOT'S WEBSITE HAS BEEN REMOVED ⚠️
So for any command help please visit https://voidemtwitch.gitbook.io/voidbot/

I may update with any bugs people have with the bot.
